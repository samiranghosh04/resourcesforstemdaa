# **Resources for STEM, Design and Animation**

<p>This repository will be consisting of some of the most useful resources like articles, books, links to videos and free courses, links to other useful repositories and general career advice. The goal of creation of this repository is to make a career in STEM, animation and design more accessible for underprivileged students and for underprivileged people looking to switch careers. I would highly recommend only using the books available here if and only if you absolutelty cannot afford to buy the books and you cannot find these in any local libraries, since most of the authors have poured their hearts into the books and have created these books out of their urge to help people trying to get into their respective domains and not out of greed and therefore the authors deserve all the support they can get. If you can afford to buy the books then please buy them online or from your local book store. If anyone wishes to contribute or wants to contact me to take down something then please feel free to do so.</p>

*<p>I wish everyone reading this the best of luck for their future.</p>*
